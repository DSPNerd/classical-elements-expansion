# Classical Elements Expansion

![chart](doc/chart.png)

## What?

This is the magic system I've derived from the old European understanding of elements (*Alchemy*) as well as the Chineese Five Elements (*Wu Xing*). And yes, *Avatar* and *Naruto* had their part to play—I even hear I may of unintentionally taken concepts from *DnD* and *Warcraft* :smirk_cat:

### The elements

The four **first-order** (fundamental) elements are `Air`, `Water`, `Earth` and `Fire`, and these can form hybrids or *terrastrial* **second-order** elements: `Freeze`, `Wood`, `Spark`, `Magma`, `Dust` and `Steam`.

We also have **third-order** *celestial* elements, which dictate higher-level mechanisms of the universe: `Spirit`, `Body`, `Light` and `Dark`.

The **fourth-order** element (i.e. accumulation of all fundamental elements) has been omitted from this chart, but is usually referred to as `Origin`. It can't quite be comprehended, but it is thought to be the missing link for the secret to human life—as suggested by the **mortal bridge**.

### What it means

All elements hold a **transcendental state**, which is futher description to what the element is responsible for in the universe. `Dust`, for example, relates to "falling", causing the gravity for humans on Earth to the formation of stars.

The **projection axis and entropy axis** can be used to approximate an elements properties. The fundamental elements form the basis of the chart's orientation, i.e. `Air` (void) and `Earth` (material) is a spectrum of things materialising (projection), and `Water` (calm) and `Fire` (excite) is a spectrum of things moving (entropy).

The mortal bridge is the collection of elements which collate the existence of beings that can observe the universe, like us. It consists of `Spirit`-`Spark`-`Steam`-`Dust`-`Wood`-`Body`, which are the elements that occupy the top-left to bottom-right diagonal on the chart.


`Light` and `Dark` are the only elements to which the P-E axises do not apply, although their position above and below fire-water respectively comes from an untested notion of their unbounded entropic value.

`Light` and `Dark` are concepts understood by mortals, and so can be manipulated at will if a Magi masters the respective fundamental elements. However `Spirit` and `Body` exist in conjunction with the mortal bridge, and so useless without the `Origin` element, meaning they can't quite be "used" in the mortal world.
